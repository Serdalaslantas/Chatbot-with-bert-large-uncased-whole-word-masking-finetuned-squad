8.3 Automatic Renewal: The number of products that the Buyer can add to their store within the Software Package they own is limited.

According to the distance selling contract at https://oneamz.com/oneamz-mesafeli-satis-sozlesmesi/, the balance added as credit or balance in the Buyer's software account is non-refundable. However, you can transfer it to another user if you wish. To transfer, you can write to support@oneamz.com stating, 'I would like to transfer the credit balance in the current software to ACCOUNT ID: ........ or to the user with the oneamz software login email ........... (the user you want to transfer to).
Can you please share the email (username) you use to log into the software or your ACCOUNT ID?
In the OneAMZ profile, under the gear-shaped Settings tab, details such as the type of package you have chosen and the number of days remaining are available. You can view them from there. The calculation is approximately as follows; the difference is paid based on the number of days remaining from your previous package.
You can make changes in the Bot Rules section within the OneAMZ software. The market profitability range and rate vary for each country. Since product sales volumes also differ, the lowest price margin to be determined when searching for products will vary. Therefore, both the profit margin and the range of products that can be sold should be optimized with these settings through buy box grouping.
Lowest price difference: It shows the price difference between you and your competitor. If you set the lowest price difference to 15%, it will find products that you can sell for a minimum of 115 USD if the competitor is selling at 100 USD..
For manual shipments, if you do not perform the necessary actions, the order information is updated within 24 hours of the last shipment time. However, if you want to expedite this process; that is, if a manually shipped order is not confirmed in the seller account, after shipping the product, the buyer account Order ID can be added to the product in the orders section of the software and checked through the temporary tracking number update button. If you are a camp student, you can watch the relevant videos at https://amazonkampi.oneamz.com/. If not, you can find the relevant video in the 'Training Videos' tab of the OneAMZ Software interface.
After placing a manual order, the order ID of the corresponding order in the buyer's account should be copied and added to the 'Add Buyer Account Order ID' section by clicking on the three dots located to the right of the corresponding order in the OneAMZ orders section. You can benefit from the software training videos that are suitable for global or intermediate warehouse shipments. If you are a camp student, you can watch the relevant videos at https://amazonkampi.oneamz.com/.

"Orders sent with OrderBOT can fail for various reasons. These reasons are listed in the OrderBOT column in the Orders tab. If no reason is written, there may be an issue with your OrderBOT setup settings. In this case, you need to check the following:

Is the Order Bot installed and active? If not, you can set it up by following the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtwVyO3pAjY&t=283s&ab_channel=OneAMZ.
Is the Order Bot in the 'ON' position?
In the Orders section, have you checked the reason by clicking on the 'failed' label in the far-right column of your order?
If there is no indication in this section and you suspect the order transaction has failed, you can send an email to support@oneamz.com for investigation. We recommend manual shipment during this investigation to avoid wasting time. If you are a camp student, you can watch the Manual Order Shipping videos at https://amazonkampi.oneamz.com/. If not, you can find the relevant video in the 'Training Videos' tab of the OneAMZ Software interface."
You can track your payments and register your new card here. After completing the explanation process to the recipient, you can update the credit card reviews in the OneAMZ Software Main Screen > Settings > Bot Rules > OrderBot section. Before changing the credit card defined in OrderBOT, you must definitely define your new card to the recipient. You can update the credit card inquiry in the Main Screen > Settings > Bot Rules > OrderBot section.
After making a shipment with Orderbot, there is no need for any further action. If you are a camp student, you can watch the relevant videos at https://amazonkampi.oneamz.com/. If not, you can access the relevant video in the 'Training Videos' tab of the OneAMZ Software interface.
The address to which you are sending your order might have been entered incorrectly by your customer. Since OrderBOT automatically transfers all address information, this address detail may cause an error in the Amazon panel. In this case, we recommend manually sending your order after making adjustments like abbreviations in the address. If the address shared by your customer during the order placement is causing a length-related error in your recipient account, you can delete the repeated parts or use abbreviations for well-known regions. You can find abbreviations by searching on Google with 'abbreviation [state/city name]'. (For example, New Jersey -> NJ, British Columbia -> BC, Ciudad de Mexico -> CDMX)
Since your OneAMZ membership is service-based, the right of withdrawal (cancellation/refund) cannot be used. You have the right to freeze the remaining days of the package you subscribed to for later use, provided that you notify OneAMZ. You should send a notification to support@oneamz.com for these procedures.
When users log in to the system, a message 'Go to Change Password' will appear. They will need to go to the appropriate settings section to update their password, and this is a mandatory process. A 'Change Password' button has been added to the settings section. (This will be done once) - Users will need to update their password every three months. If the password is expired when logging into the system, a message will appear, and they will be directed to the settings section. - If a user enters the wrong password four times in a row within 15 minutes while logging in, their account will be temporarily blocked. They will see a message about the block on the login screen. The block will be automatically lifted after 24 hours or can be removed earlier by an admin. (Even if they reset the password using 'Forgot Password' during the login process, they cannot log in to the system until the block period is over). Users with blocked accounts will only be unable to log in to the software; all sync and other processes will continue normally in the background. ⚠️ In compliance with Amazon Policies, password requirements in our system have been changed as follows: The password must be a minimum of 12 characters, include at least 1 uppercase letter, at least 1 lowercase letter, at least 1 number, and at least 1 special character. It should not contain any part of your username (email) and must not be the same as any of your last 6 used passwords. - When users log in to the system, they will see a message, 'In accordance with Amazon Data Protection Policy, your login password needs to be updated for security reasons. Please go to Settings > Change Password,' and they will need to go to the appropriate settings section to update their password. This process is mandatory.
When you click the Add Credit button in the Credit Transactions tab, you can select Payoneer as the payment method. After entering the amount you want to load, it will redirect you to the Payoneer login page for synchronization with your Payoneer account. Once you enter your login details and the confirmation code sent to you, you can add credit to OneAMZ using the balance in your Payoneer account.
Thanks to the collaboration between OneAmz and Payoneer, you can now link your existing Payoneer account to OneAmz through the Credit Transactions menu. This allows you to make instant payments. You can transfer funds from your Payoneer account to your OneAmz account in USD (dollars) without a minimum limit and long waiting periods. There is a 1% commission for Payoneer payments. *Note: Manual money transfer operations to the email address info@oneamz.com have been stopped. Balances sent to this email address by users will not be reflected.
After logging into the Payoneer application or website with your information, you should enter your IBAN details in the 'withdraw and transfer' button under the 'withdraw to bank' option. The transfer time varies depending on the banks.
PriceBOT® (better than Amazon Auto Pricing) compares your competitors' selling prices with yours using its advanced algorithm, and automatically changes prices according to your min-max profitability settings. This way, you can quickly win the buy box for your products. Since PriceBOT® operates on a Re-Pricer logic, there is no need to manually set Auto Pricing in your Amazon seller account.
The priceBot (Competitive Price) feature works with the logic of Automate Pricing found in your Amazon Seller Account. Firstly, if the competitive pricing feature from a program you previously used is still active, or if you have created a rule in Automate Pricing in your Seller account, you need to turn these off and make them inactive. priceBot operates within the range of Minimum Profit and Maximum Profit you set in profitBot. If the price that priceBot generates for you is below your Minimum Profit, it does not go below this profit margin.
There can be several reasons for not finding products in Product Bot searches. We list the most common reasons for you below: 1. A link containing very few products may have been added (it is recommended to have between 50 and 400 pages). 2. The created link should have both the main category and subcategory selected. 3. Profitability rates should be checked. 4. Check the Lowest Price Difference filter. 5. If you activate most of the detail filters such as Sales Rank, it can also reduce the number of products. Except for the above items, every filter you apply (Sales Rank, search by star, source store price range, blocked seller, etc.) will result in Product BOT finding <LESS> products. You do not need to exclude FBA, SBA, Prime Seller filters because you are using the Lowest Price Difference filter. If you are searching with an ASIN file, we recommend checking the file. Some plugins and applications can create files with duplicate ASINs. Additionally, the filtering warnings mentioned above also apply to searches of this type. If you are a camp student, you can watch the relevant videos at https://amazonkampi.oneamz.com/. If not, you can access the relevant video from the OneAMZ Software interface's "Training Videos" tab.
When searching with Product Bot, the link you use must always have the Amazon.com extension. If you accidentally obtained a link from your target store, you will encounter this error. If you need more information about searching for products with a link, you can watch the video below. If you are a camp student, you can watch the Product Bot videos at https://amazonkampi.oneamz.com/. If not, you can access the relevant video from the OneAMZ Software interface's "Training Videos" tab.
In the source store, it finds the discounted products available at the time of the search and calculates the cost based on the discounted price.
Sales Rank - Sales rank on Amazon gives you an idea of how a product performs in terms of sales compared to other products in the same category. For example: Product A sells 8 units per day, and Product B sells 4 units per day. Product A will have a lower sales rank because it sells more in a day (sales rank moves in the opposite direction, the lower the number, the better the product is selling). Sales ranks regularly change and can vary significantly from day to day. Sales rank reflects the sales volume of products in your seller country. A product with a sales rank between 1 and 100 indicates higher sales. Sales rank typically ranges from 1 to 1 million. Using this filter may result in finding fewer products.

For each order, we make sales within the profit margins we have set in Profit Bot. Since we have entered a high Amazon commission rate in the settings, our actual profit is generally a bit higher than what is shown in the software. To see exactly how much profit we are making down to the cent, you can maintain an income-expense Excel sheet. You can watch the video tutorial on how to create this sheet here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5F8mBJ2PJ0&ab_channel=OneAMZ. Similarly, if you suspect any discrepancies or issues with your calculations, you can cross-check the data in the sheet for verification. If you believe there is a software-related problem, you can contact us through this link(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5F8mBJ2PJ0&ab_channel=OneAMZ).
If you have performed manual product additions or deletions from your seller account, these changes may not immediately appear in your OneAMZ panel. After any manual operation, please wait for approximately 1 hour and then click the 'Sync Now' button in the OneAMZ Settings tab. This way, the changes you made in the seller account will be reflected in your OneAMZ panel.
Hello, a section called "Certificate" has been added to the Courses page in the education panel. You can obtain your certificate from that section.
Variations requiring selection are filters for ASINs with variations such as size, color, and dimensions.
shipments@oneamz.com
You can restore deleted products by watching the relevant video: https://youtu.be/AWIbTPCjXsk (https://youtu.be/AWIbTPCjXsk)
After your order is placed, it may take approximately 2 hours for it to be reflected in the OneAMZ panel. Please allow some time for the system to update and display the order information.
"After a price change, several factors can affect the update process:

Orders May Have Been Placed: Orders may have been placed at the previous price before the update could occur.
Stock May Have Run Out: If the seller who had the previous price ran out of stock, the listing may have transitioned to another seller with a different price.
Software Account Suspension: If the software account is suspended, updates may not have been processed.
Coupon Codes: If the product had coupon codes that were not utilized, this could affect the price update.
Delayed Awareness of Orders: If orders are discovered several days later, the price may have changed again.
These are some of the possible reasons for discrepancies in price updates after a price change."
Sku (Stock Keeping Unit) - Stock Code: When conducting product scans, we assign our own stock code to easily identify our products. Later on, we can find our products in the inventory using this SKU code. This is visible only to us, not to buyers.
